# Performance Optimizations for Veo Pages

## Major Performance Issues Fixed

### 1. Removed Duplicate Script Injections
- Scripts were being injected both globally and on page navigation
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate injection in navigation handler

### 2. Replaced Persistent Logo Hider
- **Old**: Used MutationObserver + setInterval(1000ms) = continuous CPU usage
- **New**: CSS-only solution with no JavaScript monitoring
- **Impact**: Eliminated constant DOM watching and polling

### 3. Removed Flow Mode Selector v2
- **Old**: Polled every 100ms with waitForElement
- **New**: Mode changing handled in Python only
- **Impact**: Eliminated high-frequency polling

### 4. Optimized UI Hider
- **Old**: Aggressive version with MutationObserver + multiple setTimeout calls
- **New**: Minimal CSS-only injection
- **Impact**: No continuous DOM monitoring

### 5. Static Home Button
- **Old**: Used MutationObserver for dynamic injection
- **New**: One-time injection, no monitoring
- **Impact**: Reduced DOM observation overhead

## Scripts Removed/Optimized

1. **persistent_logo_hider.js** → **logo_hider_efficient.js**
   - Removed: MutationObserver + setInterval
   - Added: CSS-only hiding

2. **flow_ui_hider_aggressive.js** → **flow_ui_hider_minimal.js**
   - Removed: MutationObserver + 4 setTimeout calls
   - Added: Single CSS injection

3. **home_button_injector_safe.js** → **home_button_static.js**
   - Removed: MutationObserver
   - Added: One-time injection

4. **flow_mode_selector_v2.js** → Removed entirely
   - Mode changing handled in Python

## Performance Impact

### Before:
- Multiple MutationObservers running
- Polling intervals: 100ms, 1000ms
- Duplicate script injections
- CPU usage: High on Veo pages

### After:
- Zero MutationObservers for UI hiding
- No polling for UI elements
- Single script injection per feature
- CPU usage: Minimal overhead

## Remaining Scripts
All remaining scripts use efficient patterns:
- Event delegation instead of MutationObservers
- Minimal polling (3-5 second intervals)
- Passive event listeners
- One-time execution where possible
